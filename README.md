# Digital-PreDistortion-using-DL

This repository is an attempt to understand whether the non-linearities induced by a Power Amplifier when operated close to its peak power (to achieve maximum efficiency) can be modelled as Neural Networks of different architectures whose weights determined can suitably mimic a Digital Pre-Distorter to get linear outputs from a Power Amplifier.
